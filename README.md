General purpose asynchronous tree viewer written in Pure Vim script.

_Split windows_

_Project drawer_

## Concept

- Supports both Vim and Neovim without any external dependencies
- Support _split windows_ and _project drawer_ explained in [this article](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/)
- Provide features as actions so that user don't have to remember mappings
- Make operation asynchronous as much as possible to keep latency
- User experience is more important than simplicity (maintainability)
- Custamizability is less important than simplicity (maintainability)
- Easy to create 3rd party plugins to support any kind of trees

## Installation

fern.vim has no extra dependencies so use your favorite Vim plugin manager or see [How to install](https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern.vim/wiki/How-to-install) page for detail.

## Usage

### Command (Split windows)

![Screencast of Split windows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/546312/73183457-29120700-415e-11ea-8d04-cb959659e369.gif)

Open fern on a current working directory by:

```vim
:Fern .
```

Or open fern on a parent directory of a current buffer by:

```vim
:Fern %:h
```

Or open fern on a current working directory with a current buffer focused by:

```vim
:Fern . -reveal=%
```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/546312/73183700-9aea5080-415e-11ea-8bca-e1dea78d24ca.png)

The following options are available for fern viewer.

| Option    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-opener` | `edit`  | An opener to open the buffer. Available value is one of `select`, `edit`, `split`, `vsplit`, `tabedit`, or those values with modifiers (e.g. `topleft vsplit`) |
| `-reveal` |         | Recursively expand branches and focus the node. It must be a relative path from the root node of the tree. Otherwise the value is ignored.                     |

```
:Fern {url} [-opener={opener}] [-reveal={reveal}]
```

### Command (Project drawer)

![Screencast of Project drawer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/546312/73184080-324fa380-415f-11ea-8280-e0b6c7a9989f.gif)

All usage above open fern as [*split windows style*][]. To open fern as [*project drawer style*][], use `-drawer` option like:

```vim
:Fern . -drawer
```

A fern window with _project drawer_ style always appeared to the most left side of Vim and behaviors of some mappings/actions are slightly modified (e.g. a buffer in the next window will be used as an anchor buffer in a project drawer style to open a new buffer.)

Note that addtional to the all options available for _split windows_ style, _project drawer_ style enables the follwoing options:

| Option    | Default | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-width`  | `30`    | The width of the project drawer window                           |
| `-keep`   |         | Disable to quit Vim when there is only one project drawer buffer |
| `-toggle` |         | Close existing project drawer rather than focus                  |

```
:Fern {url} -drawer [-opener={opener}] [-reveal={reveal}] [-width=30] [-keep] [-toggle]
```

[*project drawer style*]: http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/

### Actions

To execute actions, hit `a` on a fern buffer and input an action to perform.
To see all actions available, hit `?` or execute `help` action then all available actions will be listed.

### Mappings

### Renamer action (A.k.a exrename)

The `rename` action open a new buffer with path of selected nodes.
Users can edit that buffer and `:w` applies the changes.

![Renamer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/546312/73184814-5d86c280-4160-11ea-9ed1-d5a8d66d1774.gif)

## Customize

Use `FileType fern` autocmd to execute initialization scripts for fern buffer like:

```vim
function! s:init_fern() abort
  " Use 'select' instead of 'edit' for default 'open' action
  nmap <buffer> <Plug>(fern-action-open) <Plug>(fern-action-open:select)
endfunction

augroup fern-custom
  autocmd! *
  autocmd FileType fern call s:init_fern()
augroup END
```

The `FileType` autocmd will be invoked AFTER a fern buffer has initialized but BEFORE contents of a buffer become ready.
So avoid accessing actual contents in the above function.
